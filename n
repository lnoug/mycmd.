To create a Cloud Storage infrastructure on GCP using "gcloud" commands, you can follow these steps:

Set up a GCP project and enable billing for the project.
Install the Google Cloud SDK if you haven't already done so.
Open a terminal or command prompt and authenticate with your GCP account by running the command "gcloud auth login".
Create a Cloud Storage bucket by running the command "gsutil mb gs://<bucket-name>". Replace "<bucket-name>" with a unique name for your bucket.
Set the default storage class for your bucket by running the command "gsutil defstorageclass set <storage-class> gs://<bucket-name>". Replace "<storage-class>" with the desired storage class for your bucket, such as "standard" or "nearline".
Configure access control for your bucket by setting up appropriate permissions for users or groups. You can do this by running "gsutil iam ch <permission> <user-or-group> gs://<bucket-name>". You can also use the Cloud Console to set up access control.
Upload files to your bucket by running the command "gsutil cp <local-file> gs://<bucket-name>/<remote-file>". Replace "<local-file>" with the path to the file you want to upload, and "<remote-file>" with the desired name for the file in your bucket.
Access your files by running the command "gsutil cp gs://<bucket-name>/<remote-file> <local-file>". Replace "<remote-file>" with the name of the file in your bucket, and "<local-file>" with the path where you want to save the file locally.
